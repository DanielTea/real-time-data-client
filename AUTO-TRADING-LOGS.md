# Auto-Trading Enhanced Logging Guide

## Overview

The auto-trading system now features comprehensive logging that shows every step of the AI's decision-making process.

## What You'll See in the Logs

### 🔄 Cycle Information
```
═══ Cycle #1 Starting ═══
═══ Cycle #1 Complete ═══
```
Each analysis cycle is clearly marked with start/end boundaries.

### 💰 Account Status
```
📊 Fetching account data...
💰 Account: Cash=$10000.00, Equity=$10000.00, Positions=0
```
Shows current financial status before each trading decision.

### 📈 Polymarket Data Processing
```
📈 Processing 59 Polymarket predictions...
```
Indicates how many market predictions are being analyzed.

### 🔧 Tool Usage (NEW!)
```
🔧 Using tool: read_trading_memory({})
✅ Tool result: {"content": "", "line_count": 0}

🔧 Using tool: get_account({})
✅ Tool result: {"cash": 10000.0, "equity": 10000.0...}

🔧 Using tool: get_technical_indicators({"symbol": "BTCUSDT", "timeframe": "1Day"})
✅ Tool result: {"symbol": "BTCUSDT", "rsi": 45.2...}

🔧 Using tool: place_crypto_order({"symbol": "BTCUSDT", "side": "buy", "notional": 100, "leverage": 10})
✅ Tool result: {"order_id": "12345", "status": "filled"...}
```
Every tool the AI uses is now logged with:
- Tool name and parameters
- Result returned by the tool

### 💬 AI Reasoning
```
💬 AI Decision: Based on the Polymarket prediction "Bitcoin to hit $100k" at 75% probability and technical indicators showing RSI at 45 (neutral) with MACD bullish crossover, I'm entering a long position on BTC with 10x leverage...
```
Shows the AI's final reasoning and decision.

### ⏳ Timing Information
```
⏳ Sleeping for 300 seconds...
```
Shows when the system is waiting between cycles.

### ❌ Error Handling
```
❌ Auto-trading error: Insufficient balance
```
Any errors are clearly logged for debugging.

## Log Types

The system uses different log types for different messages:

- **success** 🟢 - Successful operations (green)
- **info** 🔵 - Informational messages (blue)
- **warning** 🟡 - Warnings (yellow)
- **error** 🔴 - Errors (red)
- **tool** 🔧 - Tool usage
- **tool_result** ✅ - Tool results
- **ai_response** 💬 - AI's final decision

## Benefits

### 🔍 Full Transparency
You can now see exactly:
- What data the AI is analyzing
- Which tools it's using
- What results it's getting
- How it's making decisions

### 🐛 Easy Debugging
If something goes wrong, you can trace:
- Which tool failed
- What parameters were used
- What error was returned

### 📊 Performance Tracking
Monitor:
- How many trades are executed
- Success/failure rates
- Tool usage patterns

### 🎓 Learning
Understand:
- The AI's decision-making process
- What technical indicators it values
- How it interprets Polymarket predictions

## Configuration

The logging system automatically activates when auto-trading is running. No configuration needed!

The check interval (default 300 seconds = 5 minutes) controls how often cycles run.

## Tips

1. **Watch the tool logs** - If the AI isn't using trading tools (`place_crypto_order`, `place_stock_order`), it means it didn't find high-conviction setups
2. **Check account fetching** - The first tools should be `read_trading_memory`, `get_account`, and `get_all_positions`
3. **Monitor technical analysis** - Look for `get_technical_indicators` calls to see what the AI is analyzing
4. **Review AI decisions** - The final "AI Decision" message explains the reasoning

## Troubleshooting

### No tool logs appearing
- Ensure auto-trading is active (status shows 🟢 Active)
- Check that broker credentials are configured
- Verify AI API key (Claude or DeepSeek) is set

### Tools failing
- Check account balance (insufficient funds)
- Verify broker API credentials
- Ensure symbols are correctly formatted (BTCUSDT, not BTC)

### No trades being executed
- AI may not find high-conviction signals (>65% Polymarket probability)
- Technical indicators may not confirm
- Risk management may prevent trades (position sizing, etc.)
