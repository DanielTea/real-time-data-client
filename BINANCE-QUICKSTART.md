```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Leverage Explained

- **5x leverage**: $100 controls $500 worth of crypto
- **10x leverage**: $100 controls $1,000 worth of crypto
- **20x leverage**: $100 controls $2,000 worth of crypto
- **100x leverage**: $100 controls $10,000 worth of crypto

**WARNING**: Higher leverage = Higher risk of liquidation!

### Liquidation Risk

If the price moves against you:
- **5x leverage**: Liquidated at ~20% loss
- **10x leverage**: Liquidated at ~10% loss
- **20x leverage**: Liquidated at ~5% loss
- **100x leverage**: Liquidated at ~1% loss

**Always use stop losses!**

### Symbol Formats

Binance uses symbols without slashes:
- Bitcoin: `BTCUSDT` (not `BTC/USD`)
- Ethereum: `ETHUSDT` (not `ETH/USD`)
- Solana: `SOLUSDT` (not `SOL/USD`)

Don't worry - the app automatically converts them!

### Paper Trading Balance

Binance testnet gives you **10,000 USDT** to practice with.

If you run out:
1. Go to https://testnet.binancefuture.com/
2. Click "Get Test Funds"
3. Your balance will be topped up

## üéØ Recommended Strategy for Beginners

### Start Conservative

1. **Use paper trading first** (at least 1 week)
2. **Start with low leverage** (2-5x, not 100x!)
3. **Small positions** ($10-50 per trade)
4. **Always set stop losses** (-5% to -10%)
5. **Take profits** (+10%, +20%, +30%)

### Example Conservative Trade

```
"Buy $20 of Bitcoin with 3x leverage"
AI: "Opened 3x long position on BTCUSDT..."

"If BTC drops 5%, close my position"
AI: "Setting stop loss at -5%..."

(Wait for price to move up)

"Close 50% of my BTC position"
AI: "Taking partial profit, closed 50%..."
```

### Scaling Up

Only after consistent profits in paper trading:
1. Increase position sizes gradually
2. Try higher leverage (10-20x) on high-conviction trades
3. Diversify across multiple coins
4. Use technical analysis

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Broker not initialized"
‚Üí Go to Settings and save your Binance API keys

### "Insufficient balance"
‚Üí Check your USDT balance
‚Üí For testnet, get more test funds from Binance

### "Invalid symbol"
‚Üí Use correct format: `BTCUSDT` not `BTC`
‚Üí Or just say "Bitcoin" - the app converts it

### "Order would trigger immediate liquidation"
‚Üí Your leverage is too high for your balance
‚Üí Use lower leverage or larger margin

### API Permission Error
‚Üí Make sure API key has "Futures Trading" enabled
‚Üí Check that you're using testnet keys for paper mode
