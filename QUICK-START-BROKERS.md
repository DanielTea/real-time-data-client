## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Always Start with Paper Trading!

-   Alpaca: Use paper trading API keys
-   Bybit: Use testnet.bybit.com
-   Binance: Use testnet.binancefuture.com

### Leverage Warning

-   Start with low leverage (2-5x)
-   High leverage (50x+) is extremely risky
-   You can lose your entire position quickly
-   Practice in paper mode first!

### Symbol Formats

Don't worry about symbol formats - the app auto-converts:

-   You say: "Buy Bitcoin"
-   Alpaca uses: BTC/USD
-   Bybit uses: BTCUSDT
-   Binance uses: BTCUSDT

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Broker not initialized"

‚Üí Go to Settings and enter your broker API keys

### "This broker doesn't support stocks"

‚Üí Bybit and Binance only support crypto. Use Alpaca for stocks.

### "Invalid symbol"

‚Üí Just say "Bitcoin" or "BTC" - the app will convert it

### API Permission Error

‚Üí Make sure your API keys have trading permissions enabled

AI: "Opened a 10x leveraged long position on BTCUSDT for $100..."

You: "What's my current position?"
AI: "You have 1 open position: BTCUSDT - Long, $100 notional, 10x leverage..."

You: "If Bitcoin goes up 5%, what's my profit?"
AI: "With 10x leverage, a 5% price increase would give you ~$50 profit (50% return on your $100)."

AI: "Successfully closed BTCUSDT position. Realized P&L: +$27.50"
```
