## 2025-01-25: JSON Serialization Fix for Binance and Bybit Brokers

### Problem
When executing trades with Binance or Bybit brokers, the server would return an error:
```
❌ Error: Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable
```

### Root Cause
Both Binance and Bybit broker implementations were returning Python `datetime` objects in their API responses. These objects cannot be automatically serialized to JSON by Flask.

### Solution
Updated all datetime returns to use `.isoformat()` to convert datetime objects to ISO 8601 formatted strings.

### Files Changed
- `brokers/binance_broker.py`
- `brokers/bybit_broker.py`

### Functions Fixed

#### Binance Broker
1. `get_crypto_price()` - Line 179: timestamp field
2. `get_stock_bars()` - Line 265: timestamp field in bars
3. `get_orders()` - Line 294: created_at field
4. `get_market_status()` - Lines 319-321: next_open, next_close, timestamp fields

#### Bybit Broker
1. `get_crypto_price()` - Line 193: timestamp field
2. `get_stock_bars()` - Line 279: timestamp field in bars
3. `get_orders()` - Line 314: created_at field
4. `get_market_status()` - Lines 339-341: next_open, next_close, timestamp fields

### Example Changes

**Before:**
```python
return {
    'timestamp': datetime.fromtimestamp(int(ticker.get('closeTime', 0)) / 1000),
}
```

**After:**
```python
return {
    'timestamp': datetime.fromtimestamp(int(ticker.get('closeTime', 0)) / 1000).isoformat(),
}
```

### Testing
After these fixes:
- ✅ Binance broker can execute trades with leverage
- ✅ Bybit broker can execute trades with leverage
- ✅ All datetime fields are properly serialized
- ✅ No JSON serialization errors

### Impact
- **Before**: Trading failed with JSON serialization error
- **After**: Trading works correctly with all brokers

---

**Note**: The Alpaca broker did not have this issue because it uses the official `alpaca-py` library which already handles datetime serialization properly.
